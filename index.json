This has never been more true for education services during the 2020 pandemic. The changing needs of the institutions they serve pushed companies like Varsity Yearbooks, a leading provider of graduation products since the 1920s, to focus on faster innovation and shorter time-to-market through a SaaS delivery model.\nIn partnership with AWS SaaS Competency Partner CleanSlate Technology Group, Varsity Yearbooks carried out a strategic transformation of their products to adapt to the new online landscape, beginning with their yearbook line. This collaboration resulted in a SaaS transformation that reshaped Varsity Yearbooks’ approach by adopting a SaaS mindset to drive revenue and market share.\nAccording to Varsity Yearbooks, they were simply trying to stay afloat before building a SaaS solution. CleanSlate helped them shift into a SaaS-oriented mindset, which ultimately increased revenue and market share. The result provided Varsity with a solution they felt completely confident in, enabling them to focus on the future and explore what comes next. Today, their team prioritizes delivering features to market within weeks instead of months and is achieving rapid market growth. The SaaS solution allowed Varsity Yearbooks to reimagine the yearbook production process and opened up possibilities for future markets. The team now constantly asks, “What else is possible?”\nCleanSlate’s work contributed to their recognition at the TechPoint Digital Transformation Awards for successfully helping Varsity Yearbooks thrive in the $1.9 trillion education services industry.\nCleanSlate has extensive experience designing and building SaaS solutions for customers through a comprehensive approach to designing and developing modern applications. CleanSlate’s expertise includes product design, DevOps automation, cloud-native and mobile development. Their core values drive their success, with the ultimate goal of leaving customers in a better position than when they started. Their team of technologists is inspired to innovate and deliver. By collaborating with clients on modernization efforts, they help identify SaaS opportunities and guide organizations to think differently. Customers must ask how a modern application built using the SaaS model can bring greater value, such as becoming a growth driver, revenue engine, superior customer experience platform, or accelerating feature delivery. Thinking differently about modernization and transforming it into SaaS and a product strategy is what differentiates CleanSlate Technology Group from its competitors.\nSolution Overview CleanSlate’s collaboration with Varsity Yearbooks was driven by the imminent risk of failure of their electronic yearbook design software. The project focused on modernizing and transforming their 14-year-old platform and infrastructure into a modern SaaS solution, while re-platforming the legacy system to run in parallel until the new SaaS MVP (Minimum Viable Product) was released.\nBy leveraging AWS services and the AWS SaaS Factory framework, we successfully modernized Varsity’s legacy software into a true SaaS product, as illustrated in Figure 1. CleanSlate’s modernization approach applied a SaaS product mindset, combining business planning with modern cloud-native application development. The multi-tenant solution designed and built by the team enabled business growth, competitive advantage, and enhanced customer flexibility and creativity.\n![][image1]\nFigure 1: Architecture model enabling SaaS delivery\nCleanSlate evaluated the overall solution from both a business and technology perspective.\nBusiness Perspective CleanSlate collaborated with Varsity Yearbooks to achieve their business goals, creating a marketable AWS SaaS solution. This process included building a product roadmap and go-to-market strategy, defining commercialization and packaging, establishing customer success metrics, using an MVP approach, and prioritizing modern UX/UI to improve usability and functionality.\nTechnology Perspective CleanSlate developed the technical foundation in alignment with Varsity Yearbooks’ business vision, delivering a well-built and future-proof solution. This included profiling, analytics, identity/access management, tenant isolation/multi-tenant storage, SaaS-focused DevOps automation, microservice architecture design, partner integrations, and modernization using AWS, Angular, and Java.\nCleanSlate built a scalable SaaS application using more than 20 AWS services, including a multi-tenant architecture with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and microservices for seamless tenant connectivity. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) enabled automatic horizontal scaling, while auto-scaling rules handled demand spikes. Application profiling, analytics, and monitoring tools such as AWS CloudTrail, New Relic, and Splunk ensured governance and scalability.\nThe SaaS DevOps approach automated the entire infrastructure with Hashicorp Terraform, integrated quality checks, and continuous integration/deployment pipelines. This enabled Varsity Yearbooks to scale their development team, run multiple environments simultaneously, and accelerate production releases with on-demand deployment.\nInitial challenges included operational inefficiencies hindering innovation, slow time-to-market impacting customer satisfaction, limited scalability and reliability, long bug resolution cycles, lack of monitoring/logging tools, and manual onboarding processes. CleanSlate addressed these challenges through modernization and a new SaaS product mindset.\nLessons Learned Overall, companies like CleanSlate must embody a passionate partnership mindset, demonstrating empathy toward customer challenges and working tirelessly to solve them with sustainable, long-term solutions. CleanSlate’s commitment to building a culture of service quality helps customers resolve both short-term and long-term challenges through improvements in processes, technology, and people. Partners must strive to understand the unique business needs of their customers, build trust, and collaborate to deliver the best solutions.\nFrom a technology perspective, leveraging SaaS Factory frameworks and performing AWS Well-Architected Reviews throughout the process truly helps companies succeed by building and deploying high-quality projects that take full advantage of the cloud. Investing in SaaS component design and strong SaaS DevOps principles enables sustainable and transformative SaaS product development.\nThe biggest lesson from this large-scale digital transformation is that change is genuinely difficult to accept, and it requires the right partnership to embrace it. Varsity Yearbooks and CleanSlate encountered several challenges but ultimately built trust, integrated quality into their processes, advised effectively, adapted well, and worked tirelessly to meet expectations — all of which fueled success.\nConclusion The successful transformation of Varsity Yearbooks demonstrates how traditional businesses can reinvent themselves through strategic SaaS adoption. Through collaboration with CleanSlate and AWS, what began as a pandemic-driven necessity evolved into a transformative business opportunity, enabling faster feature delivery, improved scalability, and greater operational efficiency. This shift positioned Varsity Yearbooks for long-term growth and continuous innovation.\nThis success story highlights the value of AWS SaaS Competency Partners, who bring deep expertise in designing and building cloud-native solutions on AWS.

These free events are now being held around the world, bringing our cloud community together to connect, collaborate, and learn. Whether you prefer to join online or attend in person, these gatherings offer valuable opportunities to deepen your AWS knowledge.\nI will be attending the Summit in Paris this week — the largest cloud conference in France — and the Summit in London later this month. We’ll have a small podcast studio 🎙️ where I’ll interview French and UK customers to produce new episodes of the AWS Developers Podcast and le podcast 🎙 AWS ☁️ en 🇫🇷.\nRegister today!\nBut first, let’s take a look at last week’s announcements.\nLaunches from Last Week At KubeCon London, we announced the EKS Community Add-Ons Catalog, making it easier for Kubernetes users to enhance their Amazon EKS clusters with powerful open-source tools. The catalog simplifies installation of essential add-ons such as metrics-server, kube-state-metrics, prometheus-node-exporter, cert-manager, and external-dns. By integrating these community-developed add-ons directly into the Amazon EKS console and the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), customers can reduce operational complexity and accelerate deployment while maintaining flexibility and security. This release reflects AWS’s commitment to the Kubernetes community by offering seamless access to trusted open-source solutions without the burden of manual installation and maintenance.\nAmazon Q Developer is now integrated with Amazon OpenSearch Service to enhance operational analytics by enabling natural language exploration and AI-powered data visualization. This integration simplifies querying and visualizing data, reducing the challenges associated with traditional query languages and tools. During incident response, Amazon Q Developer provides contextual summaries and insights directly in the alert interface, enabling faster analysis and resolution. This enhancement allows engineers to focus more on innovation by streamlining troubleshooting and improving monitoring infrastructure.\nAmazon API Gateway now supports dual-stack endpoints (IPv4 and IPv6) across all endpoint types, custom domain names, and managed APIs in both commercial regions and AWS GovCloud (US). This enhancement enables REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs—as well as custom domains—to receive requests from both IPv4 and IPv6 clients, easing IPv6 migration and addressing IPv4 address exhaustion. This update builds on recent IPv6-focused improvements, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) introducing dual-stack public endpoints for seamless connectivity across both protocols, and AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) enabling resource sharing using IPv6 addresses. Additionally, Amazon Security Lake customers can now use IPv6 through new dual-stack endpoints to configure and manage the service. Together, these enhancements ensure broader compatibility and prepare network infrastructure for the future.\nAmazon SES has introduced attachment support in its v2 APIs, allowing users to attach files such as PDFs and images directly to their emails without manually generating MIME messages. This improvement simplifies sending rich email content and reduces implementation complexity. Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) supports attachments in all AWS Regions where the service is available.\nAmazon Neptune has updated its Service Level Agreement (SLA) to provide 99.99% monthly uptime for Multi-AZ DB Instance, Multi-AZ DB Cluster, and Multi-AZ Graph, up from the previous 99.9%.

Introduce DDD methods and event-driven architecture. Guide on selecting appropriate compute services. Introduce AI tools supporting the development lifecycle. List of Speakers Paul Haverfield - Principal Storage Specialist BDM, APJ Tamelly Lim - Specialist Solutions Architect Ameen Khan S - GTM specialist for Storage - Data \u0026amp; AI pillar covering ASEAN markets Paul Hidalgo - Key Highlights Today, I had the opportunity to attend an AWS program covering an extremely urgent topic in the current context: Data Resiliency. More than just simple backups, the event opened up new perspectives on protecting digital assets against increasingly sophisticated threats.\nHere are the key takeaways I gathered:\n1. Redefining: How is Data Resiliency different from High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR)? Previously, we often focused on HA (ensuring systems are always online) or DR (recovering from physical disasters). However, Data Resiliency is a broader and more \u0026ldquo;proactive\u0026rdquo; concept:\nContext: \u0026ldquo;Everything fails, all the time\u0026rdquo; (Werner Vogels) – Everything is prone to failure, including physical keys or hardware. The Difference: While HA handles infrastructure incidents, Data Resiliency focuses on data integrity. It is the organizational ability to maintain operations, withstand, and recover even when under cyberattack (such as Ransomware) or human error. Goal: To detect anomalies and automate response processes without human intervention. 2. Why has Data Resiliency become an \u0026ldquo;Absolute Necessity\u0026rdquo;? The explosion of data creation comes with new technological vulnerabilities. Three main trends are driving the shift from Protection to Resiliency:\nRegulatory: Compliance with strict data protection laws. Technology: The complexity of Multi-cloud and Hybrid-cloud environments. Threat Landscape: Ransomware no longer just encrypts primary data; it also targets backups. 3. Data Immutability: The Impenetrable Shield A keyword mentioned repeatedly was Data Immutability.\nThis refers to the ability to create data copies that cannot be changed or deleted for a set period. In the event of a Ransomware attack, even if hackers possess top-level admin rights, they cannot alter this backup. It acts as the \u0026ldquo;Last line of defense,\u0026rdquo; ensuring that at least one clean version always exists for recovery. 4. Protection Strategy: The AWS 3-2-1-1-0 Model The traditional 3-2-1 backup rule has been upgraded to suit the cloud era:\n3 copies of data. 2 different storage media. 1 off-site copy (different region). 1 offline or Immutable (Air-gapped) copy. 0 errors during recovery (verified by automated testing). Important concepts to remember:\nRPO (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss is acceptable? RTO (Recovery Time Objective): How long does it take to get the system running again? Backup Vault: A container for storing backups, encrypted by AWS KMS for enhanced security. 5. Tool Ecosystem \u0026amp; Solutions The event introduced powerful integrated solutions on AWS:\nCommvault Cloud on AWS: Provides Air Gap Protect (secure data isolation). Cloud Rewind: The ability to \u0026ldquo;rewind\u0026rdquo; time to restore entire instances or VPCs as if the incident never happened. Clumio: An all-in-one simplified backup solution. Uses Serverless Workflow architecture (an army of Lambda functions) to optimize costs and operations. Elastio: Focuses on: Detect, Respond, Recover. Scans for Malware/Ransomware directly within Snapshots to ensure backups do not contain latent malicious code. 6. Workshop Architecture: Real-world Implementation During the hands-on session, we deployed a comprehensive protection model:\nKey Components:\nSource: EC2 Instances (EBS) and S3 Buckets containing critical data. Mechanism: Using AWS Backup Plan with an hourly schedule. Protection Layers: Primary: Stored in a standard Vault (workshop-sources-regular-vault). Secondary (Air-gapped): Copied to another Region (us-east-1-LAG-Vault) with Immutability settings enabled. Validation: Integrated Elastio with AWS Backup. Automated Malware scanning on backups. Performed hourly Restore Testing to ensure backup viability (the \u0026ldquo;0 error\u0026rdquo; strategy). Conclusion The event shifted my mindset from merely \u0026ldquo;backing up data\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;building resiliency.\u0026rdquo; In an era where cyberattacks are inevitable, possessing a Data Resiliency strategy featuring Immutability and Automation (using tools like Elastio or Commvault) is vital for business survival.\nSome photos from the event Add your photos here Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me change my thinking regarding application design, system modernization, and more effective team collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/4-eventparticipated/4.3-event3/","title":"Event 3","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Data Science on AWS Event Objectives Share essential services for data processing (sentiment analysis, comment classification, etc.). List of Speakers Van Hoang Kha - Cloud Solutions Architect, AWS Community Builder Bach Doan Vuong - Cloud DevOps Engineer, AWS Community Builder Key Highlights Below is a summary of the event content focusing on the listed services, presented in a professional report style without icons as requested.\nAWS TRAINING PROGRAM SUMMARY REPORT: AI \u0026amp; MACHINE LEARNING\n1. Overview of Technology Concepts\nTo begin the program, we systematized important foundational concepts in the field of intelligent technology:\nAI (Artificial Intelligence): An overarching concept regarding the creation of intelligent systems. ML (Machine Learning): A subset of AI that allows computers to learn from data. DL (Deep Learning): Uses complex neural networks to model patterns in data. GenAI (Generative AI): Focuses on creating new content and data. 2. AWS as a Service Provider\nThe next section introduced AWS as a comprehensive service provider. AWS offers Managed Services that help businesses apply AI quickly without investing heavily in building infrastructure from scratch.\n3. Details of Introduced AWS Services\nThe training focused deeply on specific tools designed to solve real-world business problems:\nAmazon Comprehend (Natural Language Processing Service - NLP) This service was discussed in the most detail, featuring powerful multi-language text processing capabilities:\nSentiment Analysis: Automatically classifies customer reviews and comments based on positive, negative, or neutral nuances. Text Summarization: Condenses content from long documents. Large-scale Information Processing: Supports bulk email processing and classification. Information Security: Capable of identifying, classifying, and protecting sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within text. Other Language and Text Processing Services\nAmazon Translate: Automated language translation service. Amazon Textract: A tool for extracting data from scanned documents and papers, including handwriting and complex forms. Amazon Transcribe: A service for converting speech (audio) into written text. Image and Computer Vision Services\nAmazon Rekognition: A Deep Learning-based service specialized for analyzing images and videos (object detection, facial recognition, content moderation).

My main goal was to update my comprehensive view of these technologies on the AWS platform and learn how to apply them to real-world business problems.\nSpeakers The session featured sharing from experienced experts in the industry, including Mr. Lam Tuan Kiet (Sr DevOps Engineer - FPT Software), Mr. Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi (AI Engineer - Renova Cloud), Mr. Dinh Le Hoang Anh (Cloud Engineer Trainee), and Mr. Van Hoang Kha (Community Builder).\nValuable Knowledge I Harvested:\n1. The Power of Generative AI on Amazon Bedrock This was the part that impressed me the most. Amazon Bedrock acts as a central platform, providing access to leading Foundation Models (FMs) from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, etc. This allows us to fine-tune existing models without having to build a model from scratch.\nI also reinforced my skills in Prompt Engineering, understanding better how to guide the model through various strategies:\nZero-shot: Providing a request directly without examples. Few-shot: Providing a handful of examples for the model to mimic. Chain-of-Thought: Asking the model to explain its reasoning steps for a more logical result. Specifically, the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technique was highlighted as an optimal solution to improve accuracy:\nRetrieval: Pulling real data from the enterprise knowledge base. Augmentation: Adding that data as context for the prompt. Generation: The model answers based on factual information, minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, Amazon Titan Embeddings was introduced as a tool to convert text into vectors, serving semantic search and multilingual RAG workflows.\n2. AWS AI Services Ecosystem Beyond GenAI, I also reviewed AWS\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;ready-made\u0026rdquo; AI services (APIs) that help solve specific problems quickly without complex model training:\nImage/Video Analysis (Rekognition). Translation (Translate) and Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech (Transcribe, Polly). Data Extraction (Textract) and Natural Language Processing (Comprehend). Intelligent Search (Kendra) or Anomaly Detection (Lookout). The AMZPhoto face recognition demo visually illustrated how to integrate these services into a real product.\n3. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore – Putting AI Agents into Practice This is a new framework helping to solve the problem of operating AI Agents at scale (production-ready). It supports long-term memory management, identity security, tool integration (like browsers, code interpreters), and most importantly, observability. This makes deploying frameworks like CrewAI or LangGraph safer and more effective on the AWS platform.\nPlan for Application at Work Based on what I learned, I plan to apply the following knowledge immediately:\nDeploy RAG \u0026amp; AgentCore: Propose and apply these to upcoming internal projects requiring GenAI features to increase accuracy and automation capabilities. Optimize Development Process: Use available AWS AI Services instead of building from scratch to shorten Time-to-market. Improve Model Performance: Apply advanced Prompt Engineering techniques to optimize output results for current AI tasks. Side Experience Not only did I absorb knowledge, but the event atmosphere was also extremely lively. I was lucky enough to reach the Top 6 in the Kahoot competition; however, I dropped off the leaderboard during the final questions. Nevertheless, it was still an interesting game that helped me reinforce the knowledge from this event.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/4-eventparticipated/4.5-event5/","title":"Event 5","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Summary Report: Attending AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2 – DevOps on AWS Attendance Objectives Continuing the event series, I attended the second session focusing on DevOps. My goal was to master AWS services supporting DevOps, deepen my understanding of CI/CD pipeline design, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts, as well as how to deploy and monitor containerized applications on the AWS platform.\nSpeakers The session gathered a strong lineup of speakers, including AWS Community Builders and experienced engineers:\nMr. Truong Quang Tinh – Platform Engineer (TymeX) Mr. Bao Huynh, Nguyen Khanh Phuc Thinh, Tran Dai Vi, Huynh Hoang Long, Pham Hoang Quy, Nghiem Le (AWS Community Builders) Mr. Dinh Le Hoang Anh – Cloud Engineer Trainee (First Cloud AI Journey) Valuable Knowledge I Harvested: 1. Building a DevOps Foundation The speakers helped me redefine that DevOps is not a job title but a mindset and habit of working. The core lies in:\nAutomating repetitive tasks. Sharing knowledge across teams. Continuously experimenting and learning. Measuring effectiveness with real data rather than assumptions. I also learned lessons about common pitfalls for beginners: avoid getting stuck in \u0026ldquo;tutorial hell\u0026rdquo; without starting real projects, and focus on personal progress rather than comparing oneself to others.\n2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Practice This section broadened my horizon regarding IaC tools instead of sticking to a single one. The speakers provided a detailed comparison:\nCloudFormation: AWS\u0026rsquo;s native template tool. AWS CDK: For developers who prefer writing infrastructure using familiar programming languages. Terraform: The optimal choice for teams working on multi-cloud platforms. The most important message: Infrastructure built via Code (IaC) is significantly more consistent, maintainable, and secure compared to manual configuration (ClickOps).\n3. Containers and Deployment Models The content ranged from basics (Dockerfile, Image) to advanced AWS services:\nAmazon ECR: Storage and security scanning for images. Amazon ECS \u0026amp; EKS: Two popular container orchestration options. The comparison between ECS (simple, native) and EKS (powerful with Kubernetes) helped me know when to use which. AWS App Runner: A quick deployment solution without worrying about cluster management. 4. Monitoring and Observability A system cannot lack monitoring capabilities. I understood better the roles of:\nAmazon CloudWatch: The center for metrics, logs, and alarms. AWS X-Ray: A tracing tool helping visualize request flows and detect bottlenecks. Core lesson: Observability features must be designed from the very beginning, not added after the system is built.\nPlan for Application at Work Specifically, I plan to apply this knowledge to the team\u0026rsquo;s upcoming AI Chatbot Project:\nEstablish CI/CD Pipeline: Use AWS CodePipeline to automate the entire process from Build, Test, to Deploy. The goal is to ensure every code update is tested and pushed to production smoothly. Implement IaC: Use AWS CDK to define all resources (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, IAM\u0026hellip;). This makes the system easy to reuse for different environments and scale quickly when needed. Applying this process will help the Chatbot project develop faster, minimize human error, and make operations easier.\nEvent Experience The session gave me a practical perspective on how modern businesses implement DevOps on AWS. Beyond theory, the real-world examples from speakers about CloudFormation, Terraform, or how to choose EKS/ECS were truly valuable.\nBeyond professional knowledge, this was also a good occasion for me to network with like-minded friends and learn \u0026ldquo;hard-earned\u0026rdquo; experiences from those who came before me.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/","title":"Internship Report","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Internship Report Student Information: Full Name: Nguyễn Công Minh\nPhone Number: 0363401520\nEmail: congminh04062004@gmail.com | minhncse182968@fpt.edu.vn\nUniversity: FPT University HCM\nMajor: Software Engineering\nClass: AWS082025\nInternship Company: Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.\nInternship Position: FCJ Cloud Intern\nInternship Duration: From 08/09/2025 to 28/12/2025\nReport Content Worklog Proposal Translated Blogs Events Participated Workshop Self-evaluation Sharing and Feedback "},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/1-worklog/1.1-week1/","title":"Week 1 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 1 Goals: Environment setup.

BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 1.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Customer Background: The DaiVietBlood system is designed to serve the community, including voluntary blood donors, patients in need of emergency blood, and healthcare professionals in Vietnam. The primary customers are blood donors, patient families, and medical staff responsible for managing blood inventory and donation schedules. They require a centralized, reliable platform to optimize the matching process between donors and recipients and improve communication during emergencies. In the context of digital health transformation, DaiVietBlood provides a secure, accessible solution to address localized blood shortages.\nBusiness and Technical Objectives: Migrating the DaiVietBlood system from a local/on-premise environment to AWS offers superior advantages:\nBusiness: AWS allows the application to scale flexibly according to the user base, reduces hardware infrastructure operational costs, and ensures consistent performance nationwide. Technical: AWS provides High Availability and medical data security. Adopting a Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, RDS) simplifies backend management, accelerates development, and reduces maintenance costs. The system integrates comprehensive monitoring (CloudWatch) and adheres to strict security standards. Summary of Key Use Cases:\nRole Key Function Short Description Guest Access Public Information View donation guidelines, blood compatibility charts, and educational articles without logging in. Member Register/Login, Profile Management Create accounts, update personal information and blood type. Book Blood Donation Select time slots and locations for donation. Submit Emergency Request Submit urgent blood requests; the system automatically finds suitable donors. Staff Manage Requests \u0026amp; Inventory Approve emergency requests, confirm donation schedules, update blood stock. Administrator (Admin) System Administration Manage user accounts, configure donation slots, view overview reports. Summary of Partner’s Professional Services: The Skyline Team will provide comprehensive digital transformation services, including assessing the current local application, designing a Cloud-native architecture, and executing the migration of the system to an AWS Serverless environment. We commit to delivering a secure, scalable system accompanied by automated CI/CD pipelines and detailed operational documentation.\n1.2 PROJECT SUCCESS CRITERIA Functionality: 100% of core functions (registration, scheduling, emergency requests, administration) operate stably on AWS with no regression errors. Availability: System achieves Uptime ≥ 99.9%, ensuring continuous 24/7 access. Performance: Application response time improves by at least 30% compared to the local version. Emergency request processing time is reduced by 40%. Cost: Infrastructure costs are optimized by at least 20% thanks to the Serverless model and Auto-scaling. User Experience: UAT acceptance rate reaches a minimum of 95% for all user roles. Security: Full compliance with data encryption, access management (IAM), and API security requirements. Operations: CI/CD pipeline is fully automated with deployment time \u0026lt; 10 minutes. Monitoring system covers 100% of critical services. 1.3 ASSUMPTIONS Technical \u0026amp; Architectural Assumptions:\nSource Code: The current Local application (Frontend \u0026amp; Backend) is functionally complete. The project focuses on Refactoring for the Cloud (Serverless), excluding the development of new features. AWS Region: The entire infrastructure is deployed in Singapore (ap-southeast-1) to optimize latency for users in Vietnam. Note: During the testing phase, due to limited VPC configurations and Free Tier/Student resources, latency may fluctuate (estimated ~3.5s/request). Service Limits: The AWS account uses default limits (Soft limits). Increasing limits to reduce latency will be approved by the Customer when necessary. Third-party Integration: The system uses the Gemini API for AI support features. Access Rights: The Skyline Team is granted Admin access (IAM Role) to provision resources. Operational \u0026amp; Financial Assumptions:\nDomain: The Customer owns the domain name (e.g., daivietblood.com) and DNS configuration rights. Cost: The cost estimate is based on an assumption of approximately 50,000 API requests/month. Actual costs depend on usage levels (Pay-as-you-go). 2. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE / ARCHITECTURAL DIAGRAM 2.1 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM The DaiVietBlood system utilizes a Serverless-First architecture on AWS Cloud, prioritizing scalability, security, and operational optimization.\nKey Components:\nNetwork Infrastructure (VPC): Public Subnet: Contains Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway. Private Subnet: Contains AWS Lambda and Amazon RDS to isolate and secure data, preventing direct Internet access. Application \u0026amp; Data: Frontend: Hosted on AWS Amplify, distributed via Amazon CloudFront (CDN), and assets stored on S3. Authentication: Amazon Cognito manages identity and issues JWT tokens. API \u0026amp; Compute: Amazon API Gateway receives requests and routes them to AWS Lambda for business logic processing. Database: Amazon RDS stores structured data, located in the Private Subnet. DevOps \u0026amp; Monitoring: CI/CD: Uses AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process. Monitoring: Amazon CloudWatch centrally collects logs and metrics. 2.2 TECHNICAL PLAN The technical implementation process follows the Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) methodology:\nInfrastructure Automation: Use AWS CloudFormation to provision VPC, Lambda, RDS, and API Gateway, ensuring consistency across environments (Dev/Staging/Prod). Application Development: Refactor backend into modular Lambda functions (NodeJS/Python). Environment variables and sensitive information (DB credentials) are securely encrypted. CI/CD Process: Source (GitHub) -\u0026gt; Build (CodeBuild) -\u0026gt; Deploy (CloudFormation/CodeDeploy). Includes a Manual Approval step before deploying to the Production environment. Testing Strategy: Unit Tests for Lambda, Integration Tests for API, and Load Tests to ensure capacity. 2.3 PROJECT PLAN The project applies the Agile Scrum model over 8 weeks (4 Sprints):\nSprint 1 (Foundation): Set up AWS Account, VPC, RDS. Sprint 2 (Backend Core): Develop Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito. Sprint 3 (Integration): Deploy Frontend (Amplify), finalize CI/CD Pipeline. Sprint 4 (Stabilization): UAT, Performance Optimization, Handover. 2.4 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS Access Management: Use Cognito for user authentication and IAM Roles for service authorization (Least Privilege). Network Isolation: Database and Lambda are located in the Private Subnet, accessing the Internet only via NAT Gateway. Data Protection: Data encryption At-rest (on RDS/S3) and In-transit (via HTTPS). Security Monitoring: CloudWatch Logs record all activities for auditing and intrusion detection. 3.

Complex Auto-scaling for the Database layer (currently using basic RDS). Deep Latency Optimization for regions outside Singapore. Advanced Security Compliance standards such as HIPAA/PCI-DSS. 3.3 PATH TO PRODUCTION To upgrade from the current MVP to a large-scale Production system, the following are required:\nEnvironment Strategy: Strictly separate Dev/Staging/Prod environments across different AWS accounts (Multi-account strategy). Database Scaling: Migrate to Amazon Aurora Serverless or use Read Replicas to increase read/write capacity. Enhanced Monitoring: Integrate AWS X-Ray to trace requests and identify performance bottlenecks. Strengthened Security: Deploy AWS WAF with rules to block DDoS and automated bots; use Amazon Inspector for periodic vulnerability scanning. 4.

Capstone Project Initiation: Worked effectively as a team to finalize the architecture (using Serverless), assign tasks, and set up the initial development environment. The project will be an opportunity to apply all learned knowledge practically. Governance: Began understanding AWS Organizations and SCPs (Service Control Policies) as a means to manage and control resources across multiple accounts, preparing for larger scale.

Overview \u0026amp; Speakers The event focused on the most critical pillar within the AWS Well-Architected Framework: Security. The content was designed to equip attendees with knowledge ranging from fundamental to advanced levels regarding identity, monitoring, infrastructure protection, data protection, and incident response processes.\nSpeakers \u0026amp; Experts: The event gathered experts from the AWS Community (AWS Community Builders), AWS Cloud Club Captains from various universities (HCMUTE, SGU, PTIT, HUFLIT), Cloud Engineers from FCJ, and specially featuring Mendel Grabski (Security \u0026amp; DevOps Expert).\nAbout AWS Cloud Club: This is a network connecting students and professionals, helping to develop technical leadership skills, providing hands-on experiences, and offering long-term mentoring opportunities. The participating Cloud Clubs under FCJA include: HCMUTE, SGU, PTIT, and HUFLIT.\n2. Key Technical Highlights A. Identity \u0026amp; Access Management (IAM) IAM is defined as the \u0026ldquo;first line of defense.\u0026rdquo; The session emphasized the shift from manual management to automation and strict adherence to key principles:\nLeast Privilege Principle: Grant only the necessary permissions required to perform a task. Root User Protection: Delete access keys immediately after creation. Service Control Policies (SCPs): Use Organization-level policies to set a \u0026ldquo;ceiling\u0026rdquo; (maximum available permissions) for member accounts (Note: SCPs only filter permissions; they do not grant them). Permission Boundaries: Set the maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to a specific User/Role. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Encouraged the use of FIDO2 (hardware keys/biometrics) over traditional TOTP. Credential Rotation: Use AWS Secrets Manager to automate the rotation process (create -\u0026gt; set -\u0026gt; test -\u0026gt; finish) and integrate with EventBridge to manage schedules, eliminating risks associated with \u0026ldquo;hardcoded credentials.\u0026rdquo; B. Continuous Monitoring \u0026amp; Threat Detection The focus was on building comprehensive visibility and automated response capabilities:\nMulti-Layer Monitoring: Combining CloudTrail (recording API calls, S3/Lambda access) and VPC Flow Logs (network traffic). Event-Driven Security: Using EventBridge as a central event bus to route real-time alerts to Lambda/SNS/SQS or coordinate actions across different accounts (Cross-account routing). Detection-as-Code: Managing detection rules and queries (CloudTrail Lake queries) as code (version control) to ensure consistent deployment across the organization. Deep Dive into Amazon GuardDuty: This is an intelligent threat detection solution that operates continuously based on three main data sources: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs.\nExpanded Coverage: Protection for S3, EKS, RDS (brute-force detection), Lambda (suspicious network activity), and Malware Protection (EBS scanning). Runtime Monitoring: Uses an Agent to monitor deep inside the OS (processes, file access) on EC2/EKS/Fargate. C. Compliance \u0026amp; Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security compliance is no longer a manual check but is integrated into the deployment pipeline:\nApplied Standards: AWS Foundational Security Best Practices, CIS Benchmark, PCI DSS, NIST. Enforcement Mechanism: Using AWS CloudFormation (IaC) to deploy standard configurations, combined with AWS Security Hub to automatically audit resources against defined standards. D. Network \u0026amp; Data Protection Network Security: Clearly distinguishing between Security Groups (Stateful - instance level firewall) and NACLs (Stateless - subnet level firewall). Introduction to AWS Network Firewall for advanced Egress filtering/IPS and integration with Threat Intelligence to automatically block malicious traffic. Data Protection: Encryption: Using KMS with Customer Master Keys (CMK) and Policy conditions to control decryption contexts. Certificates: Using AWS ACM to manage and automatically renew SSL/TLS certificates. Service Security: Enforcing HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for S3 (via Bucket Policy) and Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL rds.force_ssl=1). E. Incident Response (IR) The standard IR process consists of 5 steps: Preparation -\u0026gt; Detection \u0026amp; Analysis -\u0026gt; Containment -\u0026gt; Eradication \u0026amp; Recovery -\u0026gt; Post-Incident Activity.\nPrevention Strategy: Never make S3 buckets public, isolate sensitive services in private subnets, and ensure all infrastructure changes go through IaC with a review process (double-gate). 3. Practical Experience \u0026amp; Q\u0026amp;A The event provided high practical value, specifically aligning with the \u0026ldquo;Automated Incident Response and Forensics\u0026rdquo; project our team is developing.\nDiscussion Point: During our project testing, the team noticed that Amazon GuardDuty has a latency of about 5 minutes to generate a finding after an incident occurs. We asked about solutions to reduce this latency.\nExpert Answer:\nThe Nature of the Service: The GuardDuty latency is an accepted technical characteristic because the system needs time to analyze large datasets to accurately determine threats and avoid false positives. Alternative Solutions: To achieve near real-time detection, the expert suggested integrating 3rd party solutions like OpenClarity (open source) or building custom anomaly detection logic based on CloudTrail events. Networking: After the event, Mr. Mendel Grabski (Ex-Head of Security \u0026amp; DevOps) expressed interest and offered professional support for our project, opening up valuable collaboration and mentoring opportunities.\nSome photos from the event participation [Add your photos here] Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also changed my mindset regarding application design, system modernization, and effective team collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/categories/","title":"Categories","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"https://dokang307.github.io/Internship_Report/tags/","title":"Tags","tags":[],"description":"","content":""}]
