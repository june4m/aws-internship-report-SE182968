[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) is pleased to announce the successful renewal of its UK Cyber Essentials Plus certification. The [Cyber Essentials Plus](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) certificate is valid for one year, through March 21, 2026.

Cyber Essentials Plus is a certification program backed by the UK Government and industry, designed to help organizations demonstrate their cybersecurity posture in defending against common cyber threats. An independent third-party auditor certified by the [Information Assurance for Small and Medium Enterprises (IASME)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview) completed the audit. The scope of our Cyber Essentials Plus certification covers the AWS internal corporate network in the UK and Ireland.

AWS’s compliance status is available through (1) the [IASME website](https://iasme.co.uk/cyber-essentials/ncsc-certificate-search/) by searching for “Amazon Web Services,” (2) the AWS [Cyber Essentials Plus compliance page](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/cyber-essentials-plus/), and (3) AWS Artifact.
