### Week 3 achievement: Solid Compute Foundation and Diverse Storage Management

- **Advanced Network Connectivity:** Finalized Transit Gateway (TGW) configuration, reinforcing the hub-and-spoke network model for future scalability.
- **Amazon EC2 & Scalability:**
  - Mastered EC2 architecture, from selecting Instance Types to automation mechanisms using User Data.
  - Specifically, mastered the deployment process of EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) combined with ALB, ensuring the system has High Availability (HA) and Scalability based on load.
- **Cloud Storage Solutions:** Clearly distinguished and learned when to use EBS (Block Storage for OS/DB), Instance Store (Temporary Cache), and EFS (Shared File System).
