#### This worklog documents my 12-week learning journey and technical implementation process throughout the AWS training and internship program. The objective of this program was to build a strong foundation in cloud computing, develop hands-on experience with AWS services, and ultimately design, deploy, and optimize a complete cloud-based project following AWS best practices.

#### The entire program was completed over approximately three months, with each week focusing on a specific set of skills or an architectural milestone. My learning and implementation process included:

- Gaining familiarity with AWS fundamentals (IAM, VPC, EC2, S3, CloudFront, etc.)

- Completing hands-on labs on security, cost optimization, and multi-factor authentication

- Strengthening knowledge of compute, storage, networking, and serverless services

- Designing the system architecture for the capstone project

- Implementing best practices for performance, scalability, and cost efficiency

- Building, deploying, and finalizing the complete cloud-based solution
