### Week 5 achievement: Governance, Security, and Serverless Mindset

- **AWS Security & Identity Management:** Reinforced knowledge of the Shared Responsibility Model and identity management tools (Cognito, Identity Center). Mastered the roles of KMS and Security Hub in ensuring overall security posture.
- **Serverless Architecture Research:** Completed in-depth research on the Serverless model, focusing on Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This is the foundation for the group project deployment.
- **Capstone Project Initiation:** Worked effectively as a team to finalize the architecture (using Serverless), assign tasks, and set up the initial development environment. The project will be an opportunity to apply all learned knowledge practically.
- **Governance:** Began understanding AWS Organizations and SCPs (Service Control Policies) as a means to manage and control resources across multiple accounts, preparing for larger scale.
