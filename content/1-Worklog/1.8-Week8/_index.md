### Week 8 achievement: Consolidating High-Performance & Cost-Optimized Architectures

- **High-Performance Architecture Mastery:**

  - Deepened understanding of **Serverless Containers (AWS Fargate)** vs. **Event-Driven Compute (AWS Lambda)**, and when to apply each for optimal performance.
  - Reinforced the mechanics of **Auto Scaling** triggered by CloudWatch metrics to ensure system stability under varying loads.

- **Cost Optimization Strategies:**

  - Mastered the use of **AWS Cost Explorer** to analyze spending patterns.
  - Reviewed **S3 Storage Tiering** and Lifecycle policies to automate cost savings for data storage.
  - Consolidated understanding of networking costs, specifically focusing on **NAT Gateways** within a complete VPC architecture.

- **Knowledge Validation:**
  - Successfully completed the **Midterm Exam**, validating the ability to design architectures that balance performance, security, and cost-effectiveness. The exam highlighted areas of strength in networking and areas for further refinement in serverless orchestration.
